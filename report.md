# Project Exam 1

This blog site is dedicated to the culinary arts, specifically focusing on healthy eating. It serves as a treasure trove of wholesome recipes, aiming to inspire readers to embrace a nutritious lifestyle through food. Our mission is to share a diverse array of healthy recipes that do not compromise on flavor or satisfaction.

## Description

In the development of this project, a modular architecture was a key focus, streamlining the codebase for efficiency and maintainability. The core of the project's functionality hinges on a single fetch utility, with three additional functions intricately designed to rely on this core component, ensuring a cohesive and scalable structure. Initially, there was a misunderstanding regarding the use of the assigned repository for the project. I didn't realize I had to use the Repository I was assigned by Noroff, and as such I wrote the project in a personal repository which I will link here. https://github.com/KevinHavn/Good-Food-Mood
